# Open Crumb
The open source bread project for scientific bakers.

## What is this?
Open Crumb is a project to collect and analyse information about bread baking from all over the world, with particular emphasis on those using natural yeasts (sourdough).

Users can record their baking recipes, results, yeast cultures and flours to contribute to the project and keep track of their own baking.

There are a whole bunch of different factors that affect how a loaf of bread turns out. By collecting this information and making it open, the tech-minded baking community can use methods like machine learning and visualisations to understand what role these influences play.

## How to contribute

We are currently using RowShare as a user friendly way for contributors to make records. The first step is to [sign up for an account](www.rowshare.com). Then you'll need to ping me at g.raymond.richardson [at] gmail.com for an invite to the project. Once I've run a full background check on you, hired a private detective to investigate your connections and have your credit history you'll be ready to go. Next up, you'll probably want to create entries for the starters and flours you use!

### 1. Add a Starter (yeast cultures)

Add a new starter by filling out [this form](https://www.rowshare.com/tf/468aa303cd8641628b7d01f72c617bd2/(new)). If you're not already a member of the project, you'll need to request access and wait until you're approved (see above).

Once you've submitted a starter, you'll be able to refer to it in your recipes, saving you having to fill out the same details every time. Only you will be able to view and edit your starters.

### 2. Check out the Flours

Have a look at the flours [here](https://www.rowshare.com/t/0388a6fc4b38419aa98275f5e77b7c52). Don't see the ones you use? Feel free to start adding them in. Once they're in the database, you'll be able to select them for your recipes. Anyone can access all of the flours.

**Make sure to check if the flour you want to use already exists. We are trying to avoid duplicates!**

### 3. Record a Bake
To record a full bake (from levain to loaf) you'll need a few pieces of equipment:

- Thermometer (preferably one that can measure air and water temperature)
- Digital camera (a good phone will do)
- A white or black background for taking a picture of your bread on
- Oven thermometer (optional)

When you're all set, you can fill in [this form](https://www.rowshare.com/tf/db7dd3f3f72e46a5a54b50243510fc68/(new)). Fill a new one in every time you bake a new loaf! 

**It's recommended that you check out what information is needed in this form before your first bake. You might want to fill it in as you go along or take notes and fill it in once you've baked the bread.**
